Todas las pulsaciones en la entrada se separan por dos puntos «:». Tenga en cuenta que «pulsaciones» significa realmente eso, por lo que debe escribir lo que realmente quiere pulsar en el teclado.

Comment=Lea antes el comentario de la acción «Teclee «Hola»».\n\nQt Designer usa Ctrl+F4 para cerrar ventanas. Ctrl+F4 en KDE sirve para ir al escritorio virtual 4, así que no funciona en Qt Designer. Además, este último no usa el estándar de KDE Ctrl+W para cerrar la ventana.\n\nEste problema puede solucionarse asignando Ctrl+W a Ctrl+F4 cuando la ventana activa sea de Qt Designer. Cuando Qt Designer esté activo, cada vez que se pulse Ctrl+W, se le enviará Ctrl+F4. En otras aplicaciones, Ctrl+W seguirá funcionando como siempre.\n\nAhora necesitamos especificar tres cosas: Un nuevo atajo para «Ctrl+W», una nueva acción de entrada de teclado que envíe Ctrl+F4 y una nueva condición que detecte que la ventana activa es la de Qt Designer.\nParece que Qt Designer siempre tiene el título «Qt Designer by Trolltech», así que la condición comprobará si la ventana activa tiene ese título.

Comment=Konqueror en KDE3.1 tiene pestañas y ahora también puede tener gestos. No necesita usar otro navegador>;)-\n\nSimplemente pulse el botón central del ratón y dibuje uno de los gestos, cuando termine suelte el botón central. Si solo necesita pegar la selección, también funciona, simplemente pulse solamente el botón central. (Puede cambiar el botón del ratón a usar en la configuración global).\n\nAhora hay estos gestos disponibles:\nmover a la derecha y luego a la izquierda - Hacia delante (Alt+Derecha)\nmover a la izquierda y luego a la derecha (Alt+Izquierda)\nmover arriba y después abajo (Alt+Arriba)\ncírculo en sentido anti-horario - Volver a cargar (F5)\n(Tan pronto como descubra los que se usan en Opera o Mozilla los añadiremos para asegurarnos de que son iguales. Si quiere hacerlo usted, por favor ayúdeme y envíeme su khotkeyrc).\n\nLa forma de los gestos (algunos de los diálogos de KGesture, gracias a Mike Pilone) pueden simplemente introducirse haciéndolos en el diálogo de configuración. Puede mirar al teclado numérico para ayudarse, los gestos se reconocen como una matriz de 3x3, con campos numerados del 1 al 9.\n\nDese cuenta que debe hacer el gesto exacto para realizar la acción. Gracias a esto es posible introducir más gestos para la acción. Debería evitar gestos complicados en los que cambie la dirección del ratón moviéndolo más de una vez (ej. haga 45654 o 74123 ya que son sencillos pero el 1236987 pueden ser bastante difíciles).\n\nLa condición para todos los gestos están definidas en este grupo. Todos esos gestos se activan solo si la ventana activa es Konqueror (clase que contenga «konqueror»).

Comment=After pressing Alt+Ctrl+H the input of 'Hello' will be simulated, as if you typed it.  This is especially useful if you have call to frequently type a word (for instance, 'unsigned').  Every keypress in the input is separated by a colon ':'. Note that the keypresses literally mean keypresses, so you have to write what you would press on the keyboard. In the table below, the left column shows the input and the right column shows what to type.\n\n"enter" (i.e. new line)                Enter or Return\na (i.e. small a)                          A\nA (i.e. capital a)                       Shift+A\n: (colon)                                  Shift+;\n' '  (space)                              Space

Comment=Read the comment on the "Type 'Hello'" action first.\n\nQt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows.  In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in Qt Designer.  Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\n\nThis problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\n\nWe now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on 'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\nQt Designer seems to always have title 'Qt Designer by Trolltech', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.

The 'Send to specific window' checkbox is checked and a window with its class containing 'XMMS_Player' is specified; this will make the input always be sent to this window. This way, you can control XMMS even if, for instance, it is on a different virtual desktop.\n\n(Run 'xprop' and click on the XMMS window and search for WM_CLASS to see 'XMMS_Player').

Comment=Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\n\nJust press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\n\nRight now, there are the following gestures available:\nmove right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\nmove left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\nmove up and back down  - Up (Alt+Up)\ncircle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\n\nThe gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\n\nNote that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once.  For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\n\nThe conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains 'konqueror').
